1. Introduction
• Laser tissue ablation (LTA), is used in a variety of medical and cosmetic applications.  
• These include skin rejuvenation, laser assisted drug delivery (LADD), treatment of acne scars and Rhinophyma, and coagulating scalpels.   
• However, hard to predict crater depth and thermal injury to surrounding tissue
• We use numerical models to help predict ablation depth and thermal injury

2. Numerical model 
• Our numerical model has three portions
2.1 Monte Carlo radiation transport (MCRT)
• MCRT is a technique that allows the modelling of light transport through turbid media.
• Based upon interaction probabilities and random numbers.
• MCRT is used to calculate heat deposition due to the laser

2.2 Numerical heat model
• Numerically solve the non-linear heat equation using a finite difference method, with MCRT providing the heat source.

2.3 Numerical damage model
• Arrhenius damage integral & physical damage model.
• Arrhenius calculates thermal damage to tissue as degree of burn, i.e 1st, 2nd or 3rd
• Physical damage model physically changes tissue, i.e ablation of tissue, boiling of water, and changes to optical and thermal properties

• Background illustrates the overall numerical model
A) Incident laser light
B) MCRT
C) Normal tissue
D) Thermally damaged tissue
E) Ablated Tissue

3. Experiments
• Validate simulation against experimental data
• Experiment on porcine tissue ex-vivo
• Ablation craters measured with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
• Numerical model run with same parameters as experiment

4. Results
• Fig 1 shows example of numerical output, and thermal damage
• Fig 2 shows comparison with experimental results
• Fig 3 shows 

5. Conclusion
• Have shown that numerical model matches experimental results for a determined Ta. 
• In future the model could be used to help predict/optimise treatment outcomes for a variety of cosmetic and medical procedures
